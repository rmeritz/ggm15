1) "TLS/SSL: Preventing eavesdropping and tampering on the web"

2) Overview
- What is it?
- How does it work?
- How has it not worked?
- What I can do.

3) What is it?
https://oneofakind.solutions/wp-content/uploads/SSL-1.jpg
- Web is insecure by default
  (orginally for universities)
- TLS + HTTP = HTTPS
- Not just the web
  ( electronic mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP )
- Cryptographic Protocol
  (an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function
  and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic
  primitives.)
  (a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communication system
  to communicate between them to transmit information via any kind of variation
  of a physical quantity.)
  (practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of
  third parties)

4) How did it come to be?
http://www.technifree.com/modules/wfdownloads/images/screenshots/netscape_logo1174n.jpg
- Orginally Netscape
- Gone through many versions
- Changed name do to Microsoft

5) Cryptography
http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~shweta/img/lock.gif
- keeping secrets (conidentiality)
- verifying identities (authenticity)
- ensuring safe transport (integrity)

6) How does SSL provide these protections?
(Exchanged an atritrary number of messages)

7) Attack 1: Eavsdropping
http://citizenmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Eavesdropping.jpg
- I can just read the message you pass back and forth...
(Conidentiality)

8) Tool 1:
- Symeteric Encryption
- Conidentiality

9) Symmetic Encyrption PNG
(Plaintext -> Cipher -> CipherText -> Cipher -> Plaintext)

10) Subsitution Cipher

11) What makes a good cipher?
- Seemingly Random (Subisition can be broken with frequency anaylsis)
- Only broken via Exhastive Key Search
(A good cipher can only be broken by trying all keys)
- Computationally Secure
(If its a prohibitavitly large number of keys)

12) Block Ciphers
- 128-bit key
- 340 billion billion billlion billion possible combinations.
- Determenistic
- For a set length of data

13) Block Cipher Modes
- Repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block
- Used by SSL
- ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, GCM

14) Attack 2: Tampering
* I can try and pretend to send a message as you...

15) Hashing Function (Hash)
http://blog.varonis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/eagle.jpg
- Converts input into a fixed length
(Below just for cryptographic hashing):
- Another message doesn't have the same hash
- Fingerprint
- Unfeasable to find orginal message

16) Haven't solved the tampering problem yet because I could still tamper with
the fingerprint (hash)

17) Message Authentication Code (MAC)
- Keyed-hash
- Authenticity

22) But what about the keys?
http://www.santarosa.edu/about_srjc/facilities-operations/images/key.jpg
-  Both Symetirc Encryption and Message Authention Code rely on both parties
having secure keys.
- One key for authenicathion.
- One key for encyrption.
- Authenication key is negiated first so you can sure who you say you are when
  you agree on the encyrption key

23) Handshake...
https://rhsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tls-handshake.png
- Uses assymetric cryptography to setup a symmetric session
- assymetric is slow

24) PKI
Public Key Infrastructure
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Public-Key-Infrastructure.svg/1280px-Public-Key-Infrastructure.svg.png
- digital certificates which map public keys to entities
- The authentication part of the handshake

18) Attack 3: More tampering
-  I can drop or replay arbitary messages...

19) Preventing Attack 3
- Make a sequeue code part of the Message Authention Code
- Including a special marker for the last messages to avoid truncation


23) Puting it all togther:

  1) Handshake (Agree on authentication and encyprion keys, uses PKI and
  assymetirc encryption)
  2) Date Exchange (Use Symetric Encryption and MAC)
  3) Shutdown

20) Attack 4:
* I can stop you from recieving messages altogther

21) Preventing Attack 4
- TLS doesn't fix this
(or everything in general)

25) Attacks on TSL
- Passive Attacks
- Active Attacks
  - Man in the Middle Attacks (on the authentication process)
  - Attacks on the Public Key Infastructure
  - Implementation Issues

26) What should I do?

27 ) As an internet user?
- HTTPs Everywhere
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
- Don't click through when certificates are invalid
- Look for the lock in your browser
- https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html
(add screenshot)
- Upgrade your browser

28) As a developer or sysadmin:
- enable TSL
- it only works if its configured properly
- Deployment Best Practices
- https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/index.html
- Server Test
